        <h2>A Brief History of Oncology</h2>
        <p>Medical Oncology is one of the newest disciplines in medicine, developing separate subspecialty training in the 1970s. In 2009 there was an analysis that projected there to be a shortage of medical oncologists to adequately care for a growing population of patients who live longer with their disease due to improvements in therapy. In the 21st century many primary care physicians should find a larger part of their practice involving surveillance / survivorship care of cancer patients.</p>
        
        <p>Cancer has obviously been known since agent times – it is the Greeks who likened it to a crab inside a person due to its physical appearance. The incidence may have been lower until modern times – perhaps due to competing mortality from infectious agents and increasing longeivity as competing mortality. In the late 20th century cardiac disease was the #1 cause of mortality in the US, but malignancy has overtaken this in the 21st century.</p>

        <p>[The crab was aptly chosen as the State mascot of Maryland – home to two important cancer institutions – the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland and the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center in Baltimore, Maryland. The Chesapeake crab grows in the polluted Chesapeake bay – where 1/3 of fish removed are found to have tumors. Nitrogenous runoff from houses built along the Chesapeake have been toxic to the local micro-environment. Highway I-95 connects Bethesda to Baltimore – riding along the Chesapeake are many trucks with exhaust trapped in by the Chesapeake Bay making Maryland the #1 cancer state most years, with the 7th worst air quality of any state in America.]</p>

        <p>Until the 1800s surgery had been the definite treatment for malignancy as medicinal chemistry had not yet become scientifically based. The development of anesthesia was obviously key for surgery to have a meaningful role. Surgery was used to resect primary tumors but but it was not until the late 1800s that aggressive surgery for cancer was modernized. Dr William Halsted – whose career at Hopkins was that of a rocket – developed theories of radical surgery for malignancy, including the Halsted Mastectomy which involved removing the Pec Major, the Supraclavicular Fossa’s contents and a complete axillary dissection. Halsted and his protégés were responsible for the development of modern cancer surgery. Some patients were cured but the truth behind malignancy – that it was often a systemic disease from diagnosis – would limit potential cure rates until the development of modern radiotherapy and chemotherapy for solid tumors. Halsted burned out spectacularly with an addiction to cocaine (used for anesthesia) and self-loathing based in part on closted homosexuality in a dramatic tale told in the novel – “Genius on the Edge – the Bizarre Double Life of Dr. William Stewart Halsted by Gerald Imber”.</p>

        <p>The discovery of radiation in the early 1900s (a fascinating tale in itself – read “The Disappearing Spoon”) led to the therapeutic use of radiation for malignancy as well as the discovery of radiation as a dramatic carcinogen. There were responses and kilovoltage radiation was particularly effective in treating superficial tumors. In the 1940s/1950s improvements in radiation led to megavoltage treatment which could reach deeper in the body. In the 1950s Dr Kaplan at Stanford developed curative radiation techniques for Hodgkin’s disease.</p>

        <p>From the 1970s to present radiation oncology has grown dramatically – now with 3 dimensional conformational treatment, computer treatment planning and dedicated physics. Originally diagnostic radiologists were trained in radiation but in modern times Radiation Oncology formed it’s own discipline and training programs, along with an impressive literature on treatment results and techniques. Brachytherapy started in the early 1900s (the sewing of radiation seeds directly to tumors) and its development proceeded largely through several institutions (such as Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York). In the 21st century radiation has a crucial role and the improvement of techniques have led to higher doses to malignancy (with better control of disease) and less toxicity to surrounding tissues.</p>

        <p>Liquid tumors (leukemia) yielded no treatment until Sydney Farber developed the use of antifolates for childhood leukemia in the 1940s. Hematology was an exciting and diverse discipline established with the development of medical microscopy – cancer patients including leukemia patients were referred to hematologists with little in the therapeutic arsenal until the 2nd half of the 20th century. This is why Hematology/Oncology remains one unified discipline in practice, often referred to as “benign hematology” (which may not be so benign) and “malignant hematology”.</p>

        <p>Cancer epidemiology is a separate entity of scientists, mathematicians and physicians interested in the causes of cancer and its’ distribution in the population. The question of who gets cancer, why they get cancer – and ultimately how cancer can be prevented – is one of the most important public health questions of first world countries. It was in 1965 that the Surgeon General put a warning label on cigarettes due to their association with lung cancer. Cancer therapy has also been intertwined with the development of clinical research including the adoption of the controlled clinical trial. The development of the Phase I, II and III clinical trials was largely due to research in cancer.</p>

        <p>In World War II it was noted that soldiers poisoned with nitrogen mustard developed tonsillar hypoplasia and bone marrow toxicity. The use of nitrogen mustard (still available as chemotherapy for certain malignancies) was used to treat Non Hodgikin’s lymphoma at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) with temporary remissions – the birth of modern chemotherapy.</p>

        <p>The National Cancer Institute was opened in 1953 and got a shot in the arm in the form of federal funding with President Nixon’s “War on Cancer”. Also during this time the National Cancer Institute was a hotbed of cancer research and training. Many male physicians started their careers here as the proud “yellow berets” serving at the NCI rather than overseas in Vietnam. By volunteering for the Public Health Service military service was avoided. These yellow berets were very involved in developing multi-agent chemotherapy regiments (e.g. the curative regimen ABVD for Hodgkin’s disease) and in laboratory work that led the future pathway for development of targeted therapy.</p>

        <p>Those yellow berets who stayed at the NCI for 20 years received a pension from the Public Health Service and went on to head up cancer centers throughout the US – drawing two salaries (the “double dip”). As such cancer training became a widely practiced discipline in most major medical schools and centers of excellence eclipsed the status of the NCI by the 1990s. Particularly fine institutions are the Johns Hopkins Cancer Center, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute at Harvard, and the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.</p>

        <p>Laboratory research and animal models developed the thought that all malignant cells must be eradicated for cure, and that treatment should be instituted at the earliest possible time when the number of cancer cells are lower – the basis for adjuvant chemotherapy. Combination chemotherapy emerged due to the low probability of a cell being cross resistant to 2 or 3 drugs – and dose limiting toxicities could be avoided through polychemotherapy.</p>

        <p>Work around the 1970s led to cures in patients with Hodgkin’s disease, testicular cancer, Burkitt’s lymphoma and the increase in cure rate with adjuvant chemotherapy for breast and colon cancer. Dr Bonadonna, working at the Italian National Cancer Institute in Milan (like the NCI in Bethesda except the food and weather are better) presented is work on adjuvant CMF chemotherapy in 1972.</p>

        <p>Bernard Fisher in the 1970s developed the idea of the lymph nodes in breast cancer being a “sample” point as a potential of metastatic spread and the Halsted mastectomy was tested in a series of randomized trials showing the less morbid lumpectomy (with radiation) achieved the same cure rate as the more aggressive radical mastectomy.</p>

        <p>In the 1970s and 1980s Molecular Biology developed as a discipline and continues to make dramatic breakthroughs. Elucidation of malignancy as an alternation in cellular molecular biology led to numerous Nobel Prizes and fame and fortune. The concept of “targeted therapy” in its modern sense – of a compound specifically targeted to a molecular alteration reached a pinnacle with Gleevec targeted to the Philadelphia Chromosome (bcr-abl translocation) for chronic myelogenous leukemia. This breakthrough in molecular biology continues to have and will have dramatic dividends in the diagnosis and treatment of malignancy.</p>

        <p>The creation of the cooperative group structure brought clinical trials from the NCI to community cancer center. The interest of pharmaceutical companies in the 1980s and on has transformed cancer care and research with the “industry trial” being the primary way for academic oncologists to distinguish themselves. Clinical trials are now available to motivated community oncologists, where 85% of cancer patients are cared for.</p>

        <p>In addition chemotherapy became safer and better tolerated in the 1980s and 1990s such that the majority of chemotherapy is designed to be given in the outpatient setting. Only multiple day regimens need be given in the hospital (and this can potentially be given in the outpatient setting to motivated patients).</p>
