        <h3>Welcome to the Hematology/Oncology Resident Rotation</h3>
        <p>
          Heme/Onc is an important subspecialty of internal medicine (aren’t they all?) – and a very interesting one which is constantly changing. Breakthroughs in molecular biology have yielded great advances in our ability to diagnose and treat cancer. This has always been a difficult rotation for house staff on many levels, but the attendings are committed to making your inpatient rotation a valuable one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your knowledge of Hematology/Oncology is an ongoing, important process for your general education as an Internist (or subspecialist). The vast majority of your Hematology/Oncology knowledge will take place outside of this month. Many of your patients on other rotations will have a history of cancer and many patients throughout the hospital have hematologic abnormalities. This month will serve as a spring-board to the Heme/Onc learning opportunities you will have throughout your Residency.
        </p>
        <p>
          Heme/Onc is a literature-intensive field – there are very few procedures to master (bone marrow biopsy being the only procedure unique to this field) – but much to understand. Cancer is a complex group of illnesses, and benign hematology has a wide assortment of illnesses to understand many of which are common (e.g. anemia) but some rare, interesting, and potentially life threatening (e.g. TTP). Both fields intersect extensively with other areas of general internal medicine.
        </p>
        <p>
          One (lesser) goal of course is to help you do well on your Internal Medicine boards. We can help you develop a strategy for preparing for the Heme-Onc portion of this exam. The boards tend to ask questions about curable cancers more than incurable cancers, about definitive treatment rather than palliative treatment, and tend to ask the same questions over time. The hematologic aspects focus largely on general hematologic knowledge (e.g. workup of anemia) but have some “zebras” that are worth knowing about.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your rotation will include a combination of outpatient and inpatient components – flexibility is encouraged and will promote learning. Hematology/Oncology is a largely outpatient practice, and seeing outpatient consults is your opportunity to see patients who are doing well and to familiarize yourself with “bread and butter” cases.
        </p>
        <h4>Resident Responsibilities</h4>
        <p>
          The attendings are interested in learning how the Residents/Interns/Medical Students think in their approach to managing patient problems. We would like to engage you in dialogue regarding approaches to diagnosis and therapy. It is expected that the house staff will read up on their patients to better make decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The type of chemotherapy is not important – the decision regarding whether it makes sense and goals of care are.
        </p>
        <p>
          Heme/Onc is also largely an outpatient process – the patients admitted to the hospital tend to be skewed in terms of being severely ill, laden with social issues including placement or the need to transition to hospice, doing poorly with their cancer, or being labor intensive (such as acute leukemics). Some patients are admitted for chemotherapy but these tend not to be the simple, routine outpatient regimens. As such the inpatient rotation can provide a skewed view of the specialty – you’re not likely to see all the patients who are in remission, cured, or doing very well with their cancer, and you’re not going to get a broad sense of the disease spectrum.
