        <h3>Tumor Board</h3>
        <p><strong>GI Tumor Board:</strong> meets Thursday from 4pm to 5pm</p>
        <p><strong>Breast Tumor Board:</strong> meets Wednesday from 12pm to 1pm</p>
        <p><strong>Hematologic Tumor Board:</strong> Thursday from 12pm to 1pm</p>
        <p>Your attendance at tumor board is expected unless directly conflicting with other resident responsibilities. Tumor boards are a wonderful opportunity to learn about management and diagnosis of malignancy. These boards are usually attended by pathology, radiology, radiation oncology, nuclear medicine, surgeons, Heme/Onc attending and relevant specialists (e.g. Gastroenterologists at GI Tumor Board). The multidisciplinary format allows for in depth examination of each case.</p>
        <p>House staff are strongly encouraged to attend and urged to present cases (to be provided by the attending) at tumor boards. Your teaching attending will meet with you before or after the tumor board to go over the nuances of what was discussed â€“ again focus on diagnosis, staging, and initial management rather than specifics about chemotherapy regimens.</p>
