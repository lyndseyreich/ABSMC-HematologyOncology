        <h3>Prepare for Day 1</h3>
        <p><strong>One week in advance:</strong> contact Susan Wong at susan.wong3@sutterhealth.org to coordinate your schedule. Contact Jazmin Farias to ensure that your badge grants you access to the cancer center offices.</p>
        <p><strong>Evening before Day 1:</strong> open up the Epic schedule for your assigned attending by navigating to the EHC Oncology HOD context and selecting the attending from the list. There you can see their daily schedule. Arrive 15 minutes before the first patient appointment. You may wish to pre-read on the day's patients.</p>
        <p><strong>Day 1:</strong> Arrive at Comprehensive Cancer Center - 2001 Dwight Way Berkeley, CA 94704. You may park in the adjacent urgent care lot. Enter through the main entrance; the cancer center is to your immediate right after you pass through security. If unsure about badge access, identify yourself to the front desk employees.</p>

        <h3>Tumor Board</h3>
        <p><strong>GI Tumor Board:</strong> meets Thursday from 4pm to 5pm</p>
        <p><strong>Breast Tumor Board:</strong> meets Wednesday from 12pm to 1pm</p>
        <p><strong>Hematologic Tumor Board:</strong> Thursday from 12pm to 1pm</p>
        <p>Your attendance at tumor board is expected unless directly conflicting with other resident responsibilities. Tumor boards are a wonderful opportunity to learn about management and diagnosis of malignancy. These boards are usually attended by pathology, radiology, radiation oncology, nuclear medicine, surgeons, Heme/Onc attending and relevant specialists (e.g. Gastroenterologists at GI Tumor Board). The multidisciplinary format allows for in depth examination of each case.</p>
        <p>House staff are strongly encouraged to attend and urged to present cases (to be provided by the attending) at tumor boards. Your teaching attending will meet with you before or after the tumor board to go over the nuances of what was discussed â€“ again focus on diagnosis, staging, and initial management rather than specifics about chemotherapy regimens.</p>
