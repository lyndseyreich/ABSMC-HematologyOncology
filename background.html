        <h3>Basics of Cancer & Subtypes</h3>
        <p>Cancer is uncontrolled cell growth. Cells can grow by hypertrophy (e.g. fat cells) or hyperplasia. Neoplasia (new growth) can lead to potentially uncontrolled growth. The process of cell growth is complex and the cell-cycle is regulated by many proteins. Either extrinsic genetic mutations (e.g. radiation) or intrinsic random mutations can cause genetic modifications in genes involved in the cell cycle – chances to proto-oncogenes that make cancer more likely.</p>

        <p>Think of cancers as one of three subtypes:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Carcinomas</strong> – epithelial malignancies e.g. breast, stomach, colon</li>
          <li><strong>Melanomas/Sarcomas</strong> – cancers of skin, connective tissue & mesenchymal origin</li>
          <li><strong>Lymphomas and Leukemias</strong> – cancers of the hematopoietic system</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Goals and Types of Chemotherapy</h3>
        <p>For every patient with cancer it’s important to know the goal and type of chemotherapy. (For every anemia patient it’s important to know the MCV and the reticulocyte count so 2 things to know for each patient type). Let’s define these terms:</p>

        <h4>Goals of Chemotherapy</h4>
        <p>Chemotherapy is offered to patients in the belief that it can help them. While management of side effects has improved greatly since the 1970s chemotherapy can at times be difficult. With every patient keep in mind the goal of treatment:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cure</li>
          <li>Prolong Survival in a Meaningful Way</li>
          <li>Palliate Symptoms</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Chemotherapy is a general term – in cancer it typically refers to cytotoxic chemotherapy with traditional side effect profiles, but chemotherapy can be hormonal therapy (tamoxifen or arimidex, GnRH agonists), or targeted therapy (monoclonal antibodies, or multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors).</p>

        <p>For example chronic myelogenous leukemia is treated with curative intent with an oral therapy – a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Patients with certain types of breast cancer might receive therapy with three different types – hormonal therapy, targeted therapy with Herceptin, and traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy with carboplatin and taxotere.</p>

        <p>Many chemotherapy drugs are given intravenously because given their protein structure the normal human digestive process would denature them. In the 1990s and 2000s more oral agents became available.</p>

        <h3>Chemotherapy Categories & Response Criteria</h3>
        <h4>Curative Chemotherapy</h4>
        <p>Many cancers are cured by chemotherapy either definitively (e.g. Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma) or adjuvantly (in addition to surgery e.g. Colon cancer, breast cancer, stomach cancer). If the goal of chemotherapy is cure then side effects of treatment are balanced against the potential benefit of restoring a normal lifespan. Chemotherapy need not be toxic and we mitigate this as much as possible, but it would be worth it to have a patient undergo some toxicity if the goal is cure. Much research is focused on minimizing toxicity – particularly long term toxicity in the setting of cancers with a high cure rate like Hodgkin’s Disease, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, early stage breast cancer, colon and rectal cancer, testicular cancer. It is a sign of progress that the National Cancer Institute has a division and research agenda on cancer survivorship.</p>

        <h4>Prolongation of Survival</h4>
        <p>Many cancers can be controlled with therapy for months and years. As an example patients with metastatic colon cancer went from a median survival of 6 to 12 months in the 1980s and 1990s to a current of 24 months, often longer, with chemotherapy. Patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer often live 3-6 years on chemotherapy regimens, and women with ER+ breast cancer can be on hormonal therapy (i.e. pills) for years with metastatic disease. Although these patients may not be cured they value greatly these extra years of life – sometimes extra months alone are meaningful to them, particularly if a family or personal event is planned (wedding, bar mitzvah, birth of a grandchild, etc.) Multiple regimens in many cancers are possible and helpful to the patient. This is no longer considered purely palliative in that the disease course is altered.</p>

        <p>In this setting we try to minimize the toxicity through supportive care or choose regimens to minimize toxicity. Some side effects are more or less predictable than others, rare side effects are particularly unpredictable. This is a constant “trade off” between the patient and his/her doctor to balance quantity of life and quality of life [more on quality of life in a later chapter]</p>

        <h4>Palliation</h4>
        <p>It is unusual in 2025 to have chemo regimens that merely palliate symptoms – even Temodar for Glioblastoma or Gemcitabine for pancreatic cancer can prolong survival meaningfully for patients who are responding. However, symptoms can often be palliated through chemotherapy alone, or radiation, or surgical procedures – in addition to symptom management. In this setting chemotherapy should have much less impact on quality of life as the goal is to improve quality of life, and regimens and goals are allied with this. For example in the curative setting we are careful to give full dose chemotherapy, on schedule. In the palliative setting this is not the case</p>

        <h4>Type of Chemotherapy</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Adjuvant</li>
          <li>Neoadjuvant</li>
          <li>Definitive (Curative)</li>
          <li>Metastatic (1st line, 2nd line, etc.)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Chemotherapy response Criteria</h4>
        <p>These criteria are used strictly in clinical trials using radiologic monitoring. We are more liberal in our use of the terms but please familiarize yourself with these terms:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Complete Response (CR)</strong> Disappearance of all cancer, confirmed at 4 weeks</li>
          <li><strong>Partial Response (PR)</strong> At least 30% reduction in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline study, confirmed at 4 weeks</li>
          <li><strong>Stable Disease (SD)</strong> Neither a partial response nor progressive disease</li>
          <li><strong>Progressive Disease (PD)</strong> At least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions or appearance of new lesions</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These terms obviously are limited. Consider the situation in pancreatic cancer that is unresectable (for cure). A patient is started on chemotherapy and her pain disappears. She is eating more and gaining weight enjoying a greater sense of wellbeing. This clinical response is maintained for 8 months. Her tumor marker (CA19-9) has fallen from 8000 to 52 indicating a biochemical response. A CT scan is repeated which shows no change in the size of her cancer. Why? Because a 3-D solid can have a density of a golf ball or a sponge depending on the volume of cancer. So in this setting chemotherapy is continued unless toxicity warrants discontinuation or the patient wishes to discontinue chemotherapy.</p>

        <p>We will often see dramatic clinical improvement before (or even in the absence of) radiologic confirmation – for example decreased dyspnea in patients with lung cancer who are responding to chemotherapy. In certain cancers the response can be quite fast – days in the cases of fast growing lymphomas.</p>

        <p>The language of “remission” and “relapse” originally came from leukemias. A patient is in remission from cancer if there is no active cancer detectable by clinical or radiologic means. Patients who are in remission for time periods (typically five years) are felt to likely be cured of their cancer. A relapse is synonymous with a recurrence – often metastatic recurrences are fatal, but prolongation of survival is achievable with therapy. Patients with metastatic disease have metastases at one or more site (e.g. bone, liver, lung, adrenal gland).</p>

        <p>For many cancers surgery alone (and some radiation alone) can be curative. For some cancers chemotherapy is the primary modality. Many cancers involve 2 or 3 of these modalities in treating patients.</p>

        <h3>Adjuvant and Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy</h3>
        <p><strong>How does Adjuvant Chemotherapy increase the chance of curing patients of cancer?</strong></p>
        <p>Cancer patients die from complications related to progression of local disease or distant metastases. In order to minimize the chance of metastatic disease in solid tumors primary definitive therapy (usually surgery, sometimes radiation) is given to treat the primary tumor.</p>

        <p>In the 1800s Halsted hypothesized that cancer traveled from the primary organ in an orderly fashion to the regional lymph nodes and then from there to other organs. Thus he developed the Halsted radified mastectomy for breast cancer patients – removing the complete axillary nodal basin – which would stop the cancer in its “tracks” as if a train moving from station to station (primary to lymph node) before going to other stations (metastases).</p>

        <p>In the 1970s Dr Bernard Fisher popularized the theory that the lymph nodes were a sampling of how the tumor was behaving – if there were cancer in the axillary lymph nodes it was a sign that the cancer had already spread beyond the primary organ (breast). This seems more and more correct as data in 2010 sheds doubt on whether a full axillary dissection vs a sampling of a lymph node (sentinel node biopsy) is even needed to increase the cure rates of women with breast cancer.</p>

        <p>Adjuvant chemotherapy then, was developed to kill cancer cells when they were micrometastatic – too small to be seen on imaging. Breast cancer and colon cancer were the first two cancers where chemotherapy was proven to increase the cure rate.</p>

        <p><strong>Adjuvant Chemotherapy</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>goal = curative</li>
          <li>given for a brief period of time after primary therapy (usually surgery)</li>
          <li>typically 3 months to one year total chemotherapy</li>
          <li>toxicity can be acceptable as goal is cure</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Cancers treated with adjuvant chemotherapy with curative intent</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Breast Cancer - node positive and high risk node negative</li>
          <li>Colon and Rectal Cancer - node positive and some stage II</li>
          <li>Ovarian Cancer</li>
          <li>Lung Cancer – node positive</li>
          <li>Gastric Cancer (also neoadjuvant)</li>
          <li>Bladder Cancer (also neoadjuvant)</li>
          <li>Testicular Cancer (or adjuvant radiation)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Combined Chemotherapy and Radiation (chemoradiation or chemoRT)</strong></p>
        <p>Many chemotherapy agents act as “radiosensitizers” making radiation kill cancer cells better than radiation alone. These agents typically have independent activity against cancer cells thus can treat occult micrometastatic disease as well as enhance radiation’s effectiveness. In GI malignancies and Head and Neck Cancers many patients receive chemotherapy with radiation. Toxicity is typically higher with two modalities at once.</p>

        <p>It is a truisim that radiosensitivity and chemosensitivity predict each other – a tumor that does not respond well to radiation is less likely to respond to chemotherapy.</p>

        <h4>Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy with curative intent</h4>
        <p>Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is given before surgery. In the case of breast cancer this can be done to make the surgery easier, or to convert a patients requirement from mastectomy to lumpectomy (occurs 33% of the time). In rectal cancer neoadjuvant chemotherapy/radiation is given to downstage the tumor (in some cases converting an APR to a LAR) and to make the surgery easier. Frequent re-evaluation during neoadjuvant chemotherapy is important.</p>

        <p>In the cases of larynx cancer and bladder cancer chemotherapy and radiation are given simultaneously to shrink the cancer and hopefully preserve the organ. Restaging is carried out and if the organ has shrunk sufficiently, additional therapy is given to maximize the chance of cure. If not, salvage surgery is performed.</p>

        <p>Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is commonly given in gastric cancer. In lung cancer, adjuvant chemotherapy is occasionally given in neoadjuvant fashion. For patients with classic IIIA disease chemotherapy (and occasionally radiation) are given with the potential goal of surgery to follow.</p>

        <h4>Chemotherapy as Definitive Treatment</h4>
        <p>Leukemias and Lymphomas are typically treated with chemotherapy with curative intent. Acute myelogenous leukemia and Acute lymphoblastic chemotherapy may be cured with combination chemotherapy, often accompanied by stem cell transplant/high dose chemotherapy. Hodgkin’s disease, Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma, Burkitt’s Lymphoma are all curable with chemotherapy.</p>

        <h3>Metastatic Treatment & Multidisciplinary Care</h3>
        <p><strong>Chemotherapy for Metastatic Disease</strong></p>
        <p>Chemotherapy can be given for metastatic disease to prolong survival. Different cancers have different chances of response to different therapies, and not all patients are the same even with the same cancer. For example one patient with metastatic breast cancer could conceivably live 10 years or more while another subset (e.g. triple negative) might have an overall survival that averages &lt;1 year. Thus the average survival of 3 years in metastatic breast cancer is just that – an average.</p>

        <p>Ovarian cancer patients can survive many years on chemotherapy and multiple lines are given. These are numbered “first” “second” “third” in all cancer subtypes. It is not unusual for a lung cancer patient to receive three lines of chemotherapy – the average survival for metastatic and unresectable lung cancer is around 14 months.</p>

        <p>Survival depends not just on the cancer and its susceptibility to therapy but also on the patients underlying health or “performance status”. Multiple medical comorbidities make patients tolerate chemotherapy more poorly and it tends to work less well in patients who are gravely ill (exception: if the performance status is poor FROM the cancer itself and the cancer can be shrunk than performance status will improve). A general rule of thumb is that a patient should be able to walk into an oncologists office if he/she is healthy enough for chemotherapy – with notable exceptions.</p>

        <p>Age by itself is not a comorbid condition but it should be noted that elderly patients tolerate cytotoxic chemotherapy more poorly than younger patients. This side effect is most noteworthy with regards to cytopenias from chemotherapy. Remember</p>

        <p><em>% Bone Marrow Cellularity = 100 – age</em></p>

        <p>In general the chance of a response is highest in the first line, diminishing with each line of chemotherapy (the law of diminishing returns).</p>

        <p>Because chemotherapy in the metastatic setting is given to prolong survival there is a lower tolerance for excessive toxicity. In the case of adjuvant or definitive chemotherapy oncologists prefer not to delay chemotherapy or reduce doses so as to not compromise the chance of cure. In the metastatic setting, dose delays and dose reductions are not uncommon.</p>

        <p><strong>Oncology is multi-disciplinary.</strong> Gynecologic Oncologists have an additional 4 years of training after Ob/Gyn residency and in most settings in the US give chemotherapy for their patients.</p>
